### Prep

- I wanted to have a clean start for the TDD reps
- hence set up some VSCode extension from scratch again
- Prettier and ESlint collided with each other
- hence had spent sometime figuring out how to make them work
- initial commit

## Rep 1

- Used getbyRoleText method as recommended in the RTL docs

## Rep 2

- Used the findByText to locate the Button as it raises exception, whereas queryByText returns null
- Tried to use the same methods as used by the Adam in the video
- Used the describe and it as per recommendation from the Daniel's TDD book
- Used a different number in each test as recommended in one of the YouTube talks on TDD
